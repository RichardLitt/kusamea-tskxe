#Kusamea tskxe - *The Understanding Stone*
---

*NÃ¬'ul kame tskxe. Poru ting nari.* A rock understands more. Look at him. - Tsu'tey

##About
This is a project to develop better computational tools for the language
Na'vi, constructed by [Paul Frommer](http://naviteri.org). While there
are a variety of tools already available for Na'vi, there are few that
are aimed at being interoperable and completely open source. All work
here will be done completely open source, on a CC Attribution Share
Alike license. 

##Joining in

There will probably be a [LearnNavi](http://forum.learnnavi.org) thread
as soon as there is something non-trivial here. This started with a
suggestion on the [G+ LN
Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/111266205988490273811)
thread. 

Feel free to join in! Send me a request.

##To do:

* Make a basic lexicon. Pulling from the current dictionary should be
  enough.
* Make a list of inflectional morphemes. Again, pulling should be
  enough.
* Make a corpus of canonical phrases.
* Make a corpus of non-canonical phrases from speakers. Scraping?
* Remake the multilingual dictionary. This time: linked entries, textual
  examples.
* Morphological segmenter. Use this to bootstrap textual examples in the
  dictionary. Use unsupervised and supervised methods.
* Morphological generator.
* Dependency parser.
